## ECE-655 [Protocols, Software and Issues in Mobile Systems]

Literature review about the challenges faced with the usage of millimeter wave and techniques that are used to overcome the challenges. Main focus is on the beamforming technique corresponding to massive MIMO framework. Various beamforming methods, analyze challenges and identify the best-suited techniques that can be employed in massive MIMO frameworks was studied. Best deep learning methods were reviewed and discussed.

## Published a paper titled "Maximum power point tracking for PV panels using ant colony optimization" in IEEE

### Abstract:
Output power of solar panel varies with respect to irradiance and temperature. So maximum power should be extracted from solar panels using Maximum Power Point Tracking. As irradiance changes continuously during the day, many algorithms fail to give maximum power as they get stuck at local maximum. In order to overcome this problem, we propose Ant Colony Optimization which obtains global maximum and improves the efficiency of solar panels. The proposed work has been implemented using Matlab/Simulink. Also, the hardware results obtained indicate the superiority of Ant Colony Optimization over the conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking methods.
